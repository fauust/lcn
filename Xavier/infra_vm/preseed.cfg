# FROM OFFICIAL DEBIAN STABLE (Bookworm) PRESEED EXAMPLE
#_preseed_V1
#### Contents of the preconfiguration file (for bookworm)

### Localization
# Preseeding only locale sets language, country and locale.
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US

# Keyboard selection.
d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select fr(latin9)

# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto

# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string xavhost
d-i netcfg/get_domain string xavdomain

# Automatic network configuration is the default.
# If you prefer to configure the network manually, uncomment this line and
# the static network configuration below.
d-i netcfg/disable_autoconfig boolean true
# Static network configuration.
d-i netcfg/get_ipaddress string 192.168.122.51
d-i netcfg/get_netmask string 255.255.255.0
d-i netcfg/get_gateway string 192.168.122.1
d-i netcfg/get_nameservers string 9.9.9.9
d-i netcfg/confirm_static boolean true

# Disable that annoying WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string

### Mirror settings
# Mirror protocol:
# If you select ftp, the mirror/country string does not need to be set.
# Default value for the mirror protocol: http.
#d-i mirror/protocol string ftp
d-i mirror/country string manual
d-i mirror/http/hostname string ftp.fr.debian.org
d-i mirror/http/directory string /debian
d-i mirror/http/proxy string

### Account setup
# Skip creation of a root account (normal user account will be able to use sudo).
d-i passwd/root-login boolean false

# To create a normal user account.
d-i passwd/user-fullname string Xavier le Terrible
d-i passwd/username string xav
# Normal user's password, encrypted using a crypt(3) hash.
d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password $6$4gVSyi20vfWI.H/2$1N8qoIcjLMJeiJCgSJz3TEIhr8/dloVSZzaJVbZDkZTvaBiU32p5JPQu.dG3a09ueUzSSq7I8ngv4vqeCto560

### Clock and time zone setup
# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# You may set this to any valid setting for $TZ; see the contents of
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values.
d-i time/zone string Europe/Paris

# Controls whether to use NTP to set the clock during the install
d-i clock-setup/ntp boolean true
# NTP server to use. The default is almost always fine here.
#d-i clock-setup/ntp-server string ntp.example.com

### Partitioning

# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are:
# - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture
# - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk
# - crypto:  use LVM within an encrypted partition
d-i partman-auto/method string lvm

# You can define the amount of space that will be used for the LVM volume
# group. It can either be a size with its unit (eg. 20 GB), a percentage of
# free space or the 'max' keyword.
d-i partman-auto-lvm/guided_size string max

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-lvm/device_remove_lvm boolean true
# The same applies to pre-existing software RAID array:
d-i partman-md/device_remove_md boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
d-i partman-lvm/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true

# You can choose one of the three predefined partitioning recipes:
# - atomic: all files in one partition
# - home:   separate /home partition
# - multi:  separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions
d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic

# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation, provided
# that you told it what to do using one of the methods above.
d-i partman-partitioning/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select finish
d-i partman/confirm boolean true
d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true


### Base system installation
# Configure APT to not install recommended packages by default. Use of this
# option can result in an incomplete system and should only be used by very
# experienced users.
d-i base-installer/install-recommends boolean false

### Apt setup
# Choose, if you want to scan additional installation media
# (default: false).
d-i apt-setup/cdrom/set-first boolean false

### Package selection
tasksel tasksel/first multiselect

# Individual additional packages to install
d-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server
# build-essential

# You can choose, if your system will report back on what software you have
# installed, and what software you use. The default is not to report back,
# but sending reports helps the project determine what software is most
# popular and should be included on the first CD/DVD.
popularity-contest popularity-contest/participate boolean false

### Boot loader installation
# Grub is the boot loader (for x86).

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the UEFI
# partition/boot record if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# Due notably to potential USB sticks, the location of the primary drive can
# not be determined safely in general, so this needs to be specified:
d-i grub-installer/bootdev  string /dev/vda

# Use the following option to add additional boot parameters for the
# installed system (if supported by the bootloader installer).
# Note: options passed to the installer will be added automatically.
d-i debian-installer/add-kernel-opts string console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial

### Finishing up the installation

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.
#d-i preseed/late_command string apt-install zsh; in-target chsh -s /bin/zsh
# ==> Run postinst.sh in /target just before the install finishes.
d-i preseed/late_command string \
  cp postinst.sh /target/tmp/ \
  && chmod 755 /target/tmp/postinst.sh \
  && in-target /tmp/postinst.sh xav "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEEmx/Ga/6WSyXJfijm2i0OP34kGg9VDtkrzEjdjq3ug VM debian"

# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note
